		  Affiliated college under the University of Calcutta in accordance to the 2(f) and 12(b) clauses of University Grants Commission, Bangabasi Evening College is still a great example of a co-educational college during the evening time offering three-year Honours courses in different subjects. In its continuing endeavour for imparting education to all its students, including a substantial proportion of first-generation learners, in a simple but effective manner the college has made its mark as one of the premier academic institutions in the state of West Bengal. Its contribution in extending frontiers of socially significant knowledge is well-manifested through its illustrious alumni as many of its ex-students hold key positions in various fields within the country as well as outside the country. Many eminent educationists, minister, policy- makers, doctors, technocrats, bureaucrats and social workers have graduated from this college. This college is now making a special effort to place in employment at the end of their college-life. Thus, the college has recently introduced self-financing courses and is planning to open more in the near future. The college is committed to providing an education that is consistent with the needs of an evolving knowledge-based society. The college has been accredited at B grade by National Assessment and Accreditation council (UGC) in 2009.
