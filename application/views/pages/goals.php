          <h3>Goals and Objectives of the College</h3>
		  
		  <p style="font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">
		  Since its inception, Bangabasi Evening College has embarked on the task of instilling a value-based nationalistic knowledge-base along with scientific understanding. Disseminating knowledge in society by this holistic and futuristic model of education as conceived by its illustrious founder Acharya Girish Chandra Bose has been the primary mission of this institution. Throughout its history Bangabasi Evening College has dedicated itself to the cause of the poor and underprivileged students. It is still continuing this mission by arranging scholarships, stipends from different agencies and by granting free and subsidised studentship and financial support to the poor and meritorious students from the Students' Aid Fund of the college. Being an evening college, this institution is serving another social need, that is extending the educational opportunities to the students who are engaged in different jobs in various parts of the city of Kolkata and its outskirts during the daytime. In fact, the main aim of this college has always been to provide educational opportunities to the poor, underprivileged and in-service students, a substantial proportion of whom are first-generation learners. Although the college does not have the requisite authority to design the curricula, the teachers are always keen to handle the different parts of the syllabi flexibly according the needs of the learners. The college has wide-ranging courses from almost all the major streams to offer to its students. Keeping in mind to the local, regional and national needs the college has, from time to time introduced a range of new courses and upgraded the existing courses so that the students are exposed to the changing needs of our society. The college also regularly seeks peer reviews from different academicians and re-orients its activities as and when some valuable suggestions for change come. Bangabasi Evening College is whole-heartedly dedicated to the all- round development of personality of all its students by imparting a value- based, liberal, modern and self-reliant education.Since its inception, Bangabasi Evening College has embarked on the task of instilling a value-based nationalistic knowledge-base along with scientific understanding.
